def is_outlier(points, thresh=3.5) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns a boolean array with True if points are outliers and False 
    otherwise.

    Parameters:
    -----------
        points : An numobservations by numdimensions array of observations
        thresh : The modified z-score to use as a threshold. Observations with
            a modified z-score (based on the median absolute deviation) greater
            than this value will be classified as outliers.

    Returns:
    --------
        mask : A numobservations-length boolean array.
